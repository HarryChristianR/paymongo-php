# Contributing Guidelines

First off, welcome and thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

Issues and pull requests are welcome. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration. Contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct.

## Issue Template

To monitor bugs and feature changes, we'll use a definitive yet simple template.

**Note: For support questions, refer to StackOverflow. The repository's issues section are reserved for feature requests and bug reports.**

```
## Context

Provide a detailed introduction to the issue and why it is relevant.

## Process

Add an ordered list of the procedures taken/to be taken on how to recreate the issue or to demonstrate the feature.

1. Contributor pushes new batch of tests.
2. Tests are automatically recognized by the CI/CD system.
3. The package re-builds and declares if the tests passes or fails.

## Expected Result

A section wherein an issue reporter may discuss what others could expect to have resulted from this process.

## Potential Fix

An optional section wherein issue reporters may suggest possible bug fixes or elaborate reasons that caused the bug.
```
